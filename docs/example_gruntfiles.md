# Example gruntfiles

Take a look at these example gruntfiles to see a few of the possible variations:

* [grunt's gruntfile](../grunt.js)
* [javascript-hooker's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker/blob/master/grunt.js)
* [glob-whatev's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/node-glob-whatev/blob/master/grunt.js)

_(Do you have a really crazy gruntfile? Let me know by filing an issue, and I'll try to include it here._
